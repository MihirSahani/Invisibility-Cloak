# Invisibility Cloak with OpenCV and Python

![Invisibility Cloak](cloak.gif)

Create your own invisibility cloak using Python and OpenCV. This project captures the background scene, detects a specific color (usually green), and replaces it with a predefined background image, making an object appear invisible.

## Requirements

To run this code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
